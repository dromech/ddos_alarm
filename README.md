DoS Alarm System
The DoS Alarm System is a Python-based network monitoring tool that detects potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by monitoring network traffic for abnormal SYN and UDP packet rates. In addition, the system uses anomaly detection with K-Means clustering to identify unusual traffic patterns.

Warning:
This tool is intended for educational purposes and authorized network monitoring only. Ensure you have proper permission before running this tool on any network.

Features
Real-Time Packet Monitoring:
Sniffs network packets on a user-selected interface.

Threshold-Based Detection:
Raises alerts if the number of SYN or UDP packets within a time window exceeds defined thresholds.

Anomaly Detection:
Uses K-Means clustering to analyze traffic patterns and detect anomalies.

Performance Metrics Logging:
Logs metrics such as true positives, false positives, false negatives, and detection times into a performance metrics file.

User-Friendly Interface Selection:
Displays available network interfaces with friendly names and allows the user to select one.

Requirements
Python 3.6+
Scapy
psutil
scikit-learn
numpy
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install scapy psutil scikit-learn numpy
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/dromech/ddos_alarm.git
cd ddos_alarm
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt, you can install the dependencies manually as shown in the Requirements section.

Usage
Run the Script:

bash
Copy
python dos_alarm_system.py
Select a Network Interface:
Upon starting, the tool will list all available network interfaces with friendly names. Input the number corresponding to the interface you wish to monitor.

Monitor Traffic:
The system will begin capturing packets and will alert you if it detects:

A high rate of SYN packets (potential SYN flood attack)
A high rate of UDP packets
Anomalous traffic patterns based on historical data
Stopping the Tool:
Use Ctrl+C to gracefully stop the tool. Upon shutdown, the system logs cumulative performance metrics to performance_metrics.txt.

Configuration
You can adjust various parameters directly in the script:

Packet Thresholds:

THRESHOLD_SYN: Number of SYN packets per window to trigger an alert.
THRESHOLD_UDP: Number of UDP packets per window to trigger an alert.
Time Window:

WINDOW_SIZE: The duration (in seconds) of the monitoring window.
Anomaly Detection:

ANOMALY_THRESHOLD: The ratio threshold used in the K-Means clustering anomaly detection.
Performance Metrics File:

METRICS_FILE: Name of the file where performance metrics are logged.
Performance Metrics
The system tracks and logs the following metrics:

True Positives:
Number of correctly detected DoS events.

False Positives:
Number of alerts raised when no actual DoS event occurred.

False Negatives:
Number of DoS events that were missed.

Detection Times:
Time taken to detect each event.

Metrics are logged at the end of each time window in the performance_metrics.txt file.

Code Overview
Packet Sniffing:
Uses Scapyâ€™s sniff function to capture IP packets on the selected network interface.

Processing Packets:
Each packet is analyzed in process_packet(). The script increments counters for SYN and UDP packets, prints alerts when thresholds are exceeded, and stores data for anomaly detection.

Anomaly Detection:
The detect_anomaly() function employs K-Means clustering to compare traffic patterns against historical data.

Interface Selection:
Functions get_friendly_names(), list_interfaces_with_names(), and select_interface() provide a user-friendly mechanism for selecting the correct network interface.

Threading:
Packet sniffing runs in a separate thread to facilitate graceful shutdowns.
